            <h2>Severe Thunderstorm Watch</h2>
            Tells you when and where severe thunderstorms are likely to occur. Watch the sky and stay tuned to a commercial radio or television for information.
            
            <h2>Severe Thunderstorm Warning</h2>
            Issued when severe weather has been reported by spotters or indicated by radar. Warnings indicate imminent danger to life and property to those in the path of the storm.<br>
            <h1>What to Do Before a Thunderstorm</h1>
            <h2>To prepare for a thunderstorm, you should do the following:</h2>
            Consider how a disaster might affect your individual needs.<br><br>
            Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm.<br>
            
            <h2>The following are guidelines for what you should do if a thunderstorm is likely in your area:</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Postpone outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>Get inside a home, building, or hard top automobile (not a convertible). Although you may be injured if lightning strikes your car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than outside.</li>
            <li>Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal.</li>
            <li>Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage.</li>
            <li>Shutter windows and secure outside doors. If shutters are not available, close window blinds, shades, or curtains.</li>
            <li>Avoid showering or bathing. Plumbing and bathroom fixtures can conduct electricity.</li>
            <li>Use a corded telephone only for emergencies. Cordless and cellular telephones are safe to use.</li>
            <li>Unplug appliances and other electrical items such as computers and turn off air conditioners. Power surges from lightning can cause serious damage.</li>
            <li>Use your battery-operated NOAA Weather Radio for updates from local officials.</li>
            <li>Remember that lightning can strike as far as 10 miles from the area where it is raining. That's about the distance you can hear thunder. If you can hear thunder, you are within striking distance. Seek safe shelter immediately.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Avoid the following:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Natural lightning rods such as a tall, isolated tree in an open area.</li>
            <li>Hilltops, open fields, the beach, or a boat on the water.</li>
            <li>Isolated sheds or other small structures in open areas.</li>
            <li>Anything metalâ€”tractors, farm equipment, motorcycles, golf carts, golf clubs, and bicycles.</li>
            </ul>
