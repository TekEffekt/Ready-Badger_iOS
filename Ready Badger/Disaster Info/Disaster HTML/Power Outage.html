            <li>Report and get updates on your outage by calling your local electrical company (if in Wisconsin, call WE at (800)662-4797).</li>

            <li>Keep refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Use manual operation of garage door.</li>
            <li>Go to safe shelter if your home is extremely cold or hot.</li>
            <li>Use battery-operated lights rather than candles.</li>
            <li>Use generators properly.</li>
            <li>Leave a single light on to alert you when power is restored.</li>

            <h1>Food Safety</h1>
            <h2>Frozen</h2>
            Thawed or partially thawed food in the freezer may be safely refrozen if it still contains ice crystals or is at 40 degrees F or below. Partial thawing and refreezing may affect the quality of some food, but the food will be safe to eat.
            <br><br>
            If you keep an appliance thermometer in your freezer, it is easy to tell whether food is safe. When the power comes back on, check the thermometer. If it reads 40 degrees F or below, the food is safe and can be refrozen.
            <br><br>
            <b>Never taste food to determine its safety!</b> You cannot rely on appearance or odor to determine whether food is safe.
            <br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> Always discard any items in the freezer that have come into contact with raw meat juices.
            
            <h2>Refrigerated</h2>
            Is food in the refrigerator safe during a power outage? It should be safe as long as power is out no more than 4 hours. Keep the door closed as much as possible. Discard any perishable food (such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and leftovers) that have been above 40 degrees F for over 2 hours.
