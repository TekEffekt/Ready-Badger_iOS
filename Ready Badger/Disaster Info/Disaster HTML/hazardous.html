            <h1>Technological Threats</h1>
            <h2>Hazardous Materials Threats</h2>
            Wisconsin has many potential sources for technological threats:
            <ul>
            <li>3 active nuclear power plants</li>
            <li>3,678 miles of railroad tracks</li>
            <li>111,517 miles of roads and highways</li>
            <li>150-200 airports</li>
            <li>Numerous active harbors along Lakes Superior and Michigan and the Mississippi River.</li>
            </ul>
                
            <h2>Chemicals are found everywhere. They:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Purify drinking water</li>
            <li>Increase crop production</li>
            <li>Simplify household chores</li>
            </ul>
            But chemicals also can be hazardous to humans or the environment if used or released improperly.
            
            
            <h2>Hazards can occur during:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Production</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>Transportation</li>
            <li>Use</li>
            <li>Disposal</li>
            </ul>
            You and your community are at risk if a chemical is used unsafely or released in harmful amounts into the environment where you live, work, or play.
            
            
            <h2>Hazardous materials in various forms can cause:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Death</li>
            <li>Serious injury</li>
            <li>Long-lasting health effects</li>
            <li>Damage to buildings, homes, and other property.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Many products containing hazardous chemicals are used and stored in homes routinely. These products are also shipped daily on the nation's highways, railroads, waterways, and pipelines.
            <br><br>
            Chemical manufacturers are one source of hazardous materials, but there are many others, including service stations, hospitals, and hazardous materials waste sites.
            <br><br>
            Varying quantities of hazardous materials are manufactured, used, or stored at an estimated 4.5 million facilities in the United States--from major industrial plants to local dry cleaning establishments or gardening supply stores.
            
            
            <h2>Hazardous materials come in the form of:</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Explosives</li>
            <li>Flammable and combustible substances</li>
            <li>Poisons</li>
            <li>Radioactive materials.</li>
            </ul>
            These substances are most often released as a result of transportation accidents or because of chemical accidents in plants.
            <br>
            
            <h1>How to prepare for a Hazardous Materials Emergency</h1>
            <ol>
            <li>Determine how close you are to freeways, railroads or factories which may produce or transport toxic materials.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to evacuate - for hours, days, or even weeks</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Prepare a "go kit" for yourself and your loved ones</li>
            <li>Develop an emergency plan and practice it</li>
            <li>Create plans and kits for your pets</li>
            </ul>
            Have materials available to seal off your residence from airborne contamination in the event you are told to "shelter in place"</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h1>What to do During a Hazardous Materials Incident</h1>
            
            Listen to local radio or television stations for detailed information and instructions. Follow the instructions carefully. You should stay away from the area to minimize the risk of contamination. Remember that some toxic chemicals are odorless.
