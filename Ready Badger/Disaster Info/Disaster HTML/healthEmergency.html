            <h1>Influenza Pandemic</h1>
            
            An influenza (flu) pandemic is a global outbreak of a new flu virus that can spread easily from person to person. Like the seasonal flu many people experience every year, pandemic flu will probably spread by infected people coughing or sneezing and by touching an infected surface. Unlike seasonal flu, people will have little immunity to the new flu virus that causes a pandemic, and many more people will get sick.
            <br><br>
            Wisconsin is taking an aggressive approach to preparing for a pandemic flu outbreak in humans or animals.

            <h1>What To Expect In An Influenza Pandemic</h1>
            When a flu pandemic occurs, it will likely be a prolonged and widespread outbreak that could require temporary changes in many parts of our everyday lives, including schools, work, transportation and other public services. Being informed and prepared for what will happen will decrease your risk. The following are some situations to expect in a flu pandemic:
            <ul>
            <li>Hospitals and doctors might be overwhelmed with sick patients.</li>
            <li>Schools and businesses might close to keep the virus from spreading or because too many people are sick.</li>
            <li>Essential supplies and services may become limited or unavailable.</li>
            <li>Travel and public gatherings might be limited to keep the virus from spreading.</li>
            <li>Public health officials may suggest using isolation or quarantine measures to control the spread of infection.</li>
            <li>There may not be a vaccine to protect people against the pandemic flu.</li>
            <li>Antiviral medicines may be in limited supply. If vaccines or antiviral medicines are available, you may be asked to go to a certain community location to get vaccinated or receive the medicine.</li>
            <li>The pandemic could last a long time. Sometimes, there are several waves of illness that occur over a series of months or even more than a year.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h1>What To Do</h1>
